## 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm currently in the **3rd semester of Systems Analysis and Development**, building practical projects to strengthen my skills in programming and software development.

I enjoy learning by doing — creating systems, testing ideas, and understanding how things work behind the scenes.  
My current focus is on **C#, Python, and application logic**, with interest in backend development and databases.
